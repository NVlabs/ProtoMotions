# Changelog

<details>
<summary>v1.0</summary>

Public release!

</details>

> **Important:**</br>
> This codebase builds heavily on [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) and [OmegaConfig](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/).<br>
> It is recommended to familiarize yourself with these libraries and how config composition works.

# Installation

This codebase supports both IsaacGym and IsaacLab. You can install one or both and
the simulation backend is selected via the configuration file.

First run `git lfs fetch --all` to fetch all files stored in git-lfs.

<details>
<summary>IsaacGym</summary>

1. Install [IsaacGym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), install using **python 3.8**.
2. Once IG and PyTorch are installed, from the repository root install the Phys-Anim package and its dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
pip install -e isaac_utils
pip install -e poselib
```
Set the `PYTHON_PATH` env variable (not really needed, but helps the instructions stay consistent between sim and gym).
```
alias PYTHON_PATH=python
```

### Potential Issues

If you have python errors:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/
```

If you run into memory issues -- try reducing the number of environments by adding to the commandline `num_envs=1024`

</details>

<details>
<summary>IsaacLab</summary>

> **Important:**</br>
> IsaacLab integration on-going. Some features may not work yet.

1. Install [IsaacLab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html)
2. Set `PYTHON_PATH` to point at the `isaaclab.sh` script
```
For Linux: alias PYTHON_PATH="<isaac_lab_path> -p"
# For example: alias PYTHON_PATH="/home/USERNAME/IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p"
```
3. Once IsaacLab is installed, from the protomotions repository root, install the Physical Animation package and its dependencies with:
```
PYTHON_PATH -m pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHON_PATH -m pip install -e .
PYTHON_PATH -m pip install -e isaac_utils

# Training Your Agent

## Backbone and Robot selection

If you are using IsaacGym use the flag `+backbone=isaacgym`. For IsaacLab use `+backbone=isaaclab`.
Then select the robot you are training. For example, the SMPL humanoid robot is `+robot=smpl`. The code currently supports:

| Robot            | Description                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| smpl             | SMPL humanoid                                                      |
| smplx            | SMPL-X humanoid                                                    |
| amp              | Adversarial Motion Priors humanoid                                 |
| sword_and_shield | ASE sword and shield character                                     |
| h1               | Unitree H1 humanoid with end-effector and head joints made visible |

## Provided Algorithms

<details>
<summary>MaskedMimic</summary>

In the first stage, you need to train a general motion tracker. At each step, this model receives the next K future poses.
The second phase trains the masked mimic model to reconstruct the actions of the expert tracker trained in the first stage.

1. **Train full body tracker:** Run `PYTHON_PATH phys_anim/train_agent.py +exp=full_body_tracker +robot=smpl +backbone=isaacgym motion_file=<motion file path>`
2. Find the checkpoint of the first phase. The next training should point to that folder and not the checkpoint.
3. **Train MaskedMimic:** Run `PYTHON_PATH phys_anim/train_agent.py +exp=masked_mimic +robot=smpl +backbone=isaacgym motion_file=<motion file path> gt_actor_path=<path to phase 1 folder>`
4. **Inference:** For an example of user-control, run `PYTHON_PATH phys_anim/eval_agent.py +robot=smpl +backbone=isaacgym +opt=[masked_mimic/tasks/user_control] motion_file=<motion file path> checkpoint=<path to maskedmimic checkpoint>`

add `force_flat_terrain=True` to use a default flat terrain (this reduces loading time).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Full body motion tracking</summary>

This model is the first stage in training MaskedMimic. Refer to the MaskedMimic section for instructions on training this model.
</details>

<details>
<summary>AMP</summary>

Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02180)) trains
an agent to produce motions with similar distributional characteristics to a given
motion dataset. AMP can be combined with a task, encouraging the agent to solve the
task with the provided motions.

1. Run `PYTHON_PATH phys_anim/train_agent.py +exp=amp motion_file=<path to motion file>`.
2. Choose your robot, for example `+robot=amp`.
3. Set `+backbone=isaacgym` or `+backbone=isaaclab` to choose the backbone.

### Path Following

One such task for AMP is path following. The character needs to follow a set of markers.
To provide AMP with a path following task, similar to
[PACER](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/trace-pace/), run the experiment `+exp=path_follower`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>ASE</summary>

Adversarial Skill Embeddings (ASE, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01906)) trains
a low-level skill generating policy. The low-level policy is conditioned on a latent
variable z. Each latent variable represents a different motion. ASE requires a diverse
dataset of motions, as opposed to AMP that can (and often should) be trained on a single (or small set of motions) motion.

Run `PYTHON_PATH phys_anim/train_agent.py +exp=ase motion_file=<path to motion dataset>`

In order to train the sword-and-shield character, as in the original paper:
1. Git clone [ASE](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/ASE)
2. Download the data from [ASE](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/ASE)
3. Point the `motion_file` path to the dataset descriptor file `dataset_reallusion_sword_shield.yaml` (from the ASE codebase)
4. Use the robot `+robot=sword_and_shield`
</details>

## Terrain

ProtoMotions handles the terrain generation in all experiments. By default we create a flat terrain that is large enough for all humanoids to spawn with comfortable spacing between them. This is similar to the classic `env_spacing` in IsaacGym.
By add the flag `+terrain=complex`, the simulation will add an irregular terrain and normalize observations with respect to the terrain beneath the character. By default this terrain is a combination of stairs, slopes, gravel and also a flat region.
To make the controller aware of the terrain we add the terrain observations using the flag `+terrain=terrain_obs`.
It is recommended to use an experiment file and add these flags in there. See `phys_anim/config/exp/masked_mimic.yaml` for an example.

During inference you can force a flat, and simple, terrain (similar to the default IsaacGym ground plane), by `force_flat_terrain=True` or by overriding the terrain type using `+terrain=flat`. This is useful for inference, if you want to evaluate a controller (where the saved config defines a complex terrain) on a flat and simple terrain.

## Scenes

Similar to the motion library, we introduce SceneLib. This scene-management library handles spawning scenes across the simulated world.
Scenes can be very simple, but can also be arbitrarily complex. The simplest scenes are a single non-movable object, for example from the SAMP dataset.
Complex scenes can have one-or-more objects and these objects can be both non-movable and also moveable.
Each object has a set of properties, such as the position within the scene, and also a motion file that defines the motion of the object when performing motion-tracking tasks.

For more information, refer to the example `YAML` files in the `data/yaml_files` folder.

## Logging

By default, all experiments are logged using tensorboard. You can also log using Weights and Biases by adding the flag `+opt=wandb`.

# Evaluation/Visualization

To evaluate the trained agent

1. Find the checkpoint. `results/<experiment name>/lightning_logs/version_<number>`
2. Evaluate using `PYTHON_PATH phys_anim/eval_agent.py +robot=<robot> +backbone=<backend> motion_file=<path to motion file> checkpoint=results/<experiment name>/lightning_logs/version_<number>/last.ckpt`.
3. By setting `headless=False` it will also render (live visualization) the evaluation.

We provide a set of pre-defined keyboard controls.

| Key | Description                                                                |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `J` | Apply physical force to all robots (tests robustness)                      |
| `L` | Toggle recording video from viewer. Second click will save frames to video |
| `;` | Cancel recording                                                           |
| `U` | Update inference parameters (e.g., in MaskedMimic user control task)       |


# Code structure, how can I build my own stuff?

The code is split into the standard env-agent RL dichotomy.

## Agents

The agent code (located in `phys_anim/agents`) controls the logic of the agent.
For example, ASE, implemented within the `InfoMax` class, inherits the following tree: `PPO -> AMP -> InfoMax`.

## Environments

The agent training code is agnostic to the backbone simulative environment. This is not true for the
environment.

The environment code is located in `phys_anim/envs`. The first folder defines the environment type, for example `amp`.
Within each environment folder we have `common.py` which contains all the core logic for the environment, and `isaacgym.py`, `isaaclab.py`, etc... which contain the simulator specific code (e.g., IsaacGym API calls).

## Configurations

This repo is aimed to be versatile and fast to work with. Everything should be configurable, and elements should be composable by combining configs.
For example, the `opt` folder contains a collection of config options. Some of them are:
- `wandb`: Log using Weights and Biases.
- `disable_discriminator`: Disabling AMP discriminator for classes inheriting from AMP.
- `legged-robot`: Configurations for legged robots (e.g., Unitree H1).
- `record_motion`: Record motions (states) to a file.
- `record_video`: Record videos to a file.

# Data

Training the agents requires using mocap data. The `motion_file` parameter receives either an `.npy` file, for a single motion, or a `.yaml` for an entire dataset of motions.
Keep in mind that scene-based information is only extracted from the `.yaml` files, making them a requirement for such tasks.

We provide 4 example motions to get you started:
- AMP humanoid: `phys_anim/data/motions/amp_humanoid_walk.npy`
- AMP + sword and shield humanoid: `phys_anim/data/motions/amp_sword_and_shield_humanoid_walk.npy`
- SMPL humanoid: `phys_anim/data/motions/smpl_humanoid_walk.npy`
- SMPL-X humanoid: `phys_anim/data/motions/smplx_humanoid_walk.npy`
- H1 (with head and hands): `phys_anim/data/motions/h1_punch.npy`

The data processing pipeline follows the following procedure:
1. Download the data.
2. Convert AMASS to Isaac (PoseLib) format.
3. Create a YAML file with the data information (filename, FPS, textual labels, etc...).
4. Package (pre-process) the data for faster loading.

Motions can be visualized via kinematic replay by running `PYTHON_PATH phys_anim/scripts/play_motion.py <motion file> <backbone isaacgym/isaaclab> <robot type>`.


## Download Data
1. Download the [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) v1.1.0 parameters and place them in the `data/smpl/` folder. Rename the files basicmodel_neutral_lbs_10_207_0_v1.1.0, basicmodel_m_lbs_10_207_0_v1.1.0.pkl, basicmodel_f_lbs_10_207_0_v1.1.0.pkl to SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl, SMPL_MALE.pkl and SMPL_FEMALE.pkl.
2. Download the [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) v1.1 parameters and place them in the `data/smpl/` folder. Rename the files to SMPLX_NEUTRAL.pkl, SMPLX_MALE.pkl and SMPLX_FEMALE.pkl.
3. Download the [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/) dataset.
4. Download the [SAMP](https://samp.is.tue.mpg.de/) dataset.

## Convert the motions to MotionLib format
1. Run `python data/scripts/convert_amass_to_isaac.py <path_to_AMASS_data>` set `--humanoid-type=smplx` if using SMPL-X.
2. Run `python data/scripts/convert_samp_to_isaac.py <path_to_SAMP_data>` set `--humanoid-type=smplx` if using SMPL-X.
3. Copy the converted `SAMP` data to the AMASS data directory. `SAMP-filtered.yaml` requires it in the `samp-smpl/` sub-folder and `SAMP-X-filtered.yaml` in the `samp-smplx/` sub-folder.

## YAML files

You can create your own YAML files for full-control over the process.
<details>
<summary>Create your own YAML files</summary>
Example pre-generated YAML files are provided in `data/yaml_files`. To create your own YAML file, follow these steps:

1. Download the textual labels, `index.csv`, `train_val.txt, and `test.txt` from the [HML3D](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/HumanML3D) dataset.
2. Run `python data/scripts/create_motion_fps_yaml.py` and provide it with the path to the extracted AMASS (or AMASS-X) data. This will create a `.yaml` file with the true FPS for each motion. If using AMASS-X, provide it with the flags `--humanoid-type=smlx` and `--amass-fps-file` that points to the FPS file for the original AMASS dataset (e.g. `data/yaml_files/motion_fps_smpl.yaml`).
3. Run `python data/scripts/process_hml3d_data.py <yaml_file_path> --relative-path=<path_to_AMASS_data>` set `--occlusion-data-path=data/amass/amassx_occlusion_v1.pkl`,  `--humanoid-type=smplx` and `--motion-fps-path=data/yaml_files/motion_fps_smplx.yaml` if using SMPL-X.
4. To also include flipped motions, run `python data/scripts/create_flipped_file.py <path_to_yaml_file_from_last_step>`. Keep in mind that SMPL-X seems to have certain issues with flipped motions. They are not perfectly mirrored.
5. To include the SAMP data, run `python data/scripts/merge_amass_with_samp.py <path_to_amass_yaml_file_from_last_step> <path_to_samp_yaml_file> <path_to_combined_output_file>`. An example SAMP file can be found in `data/yaml_files/SAMP-filtered.yaml` or `SAMP-X-filtered.yaml` for SMPL-X.

</details>

Alternatively, you can use the pre-generated YAML files in `data/yaml_files`.

## Package the data for faster loading
Run `python data/scripts/package_motion_lib.py <path_to_yaml_file> <path_to_AMASS_data_dir> <output_pt_file_path>` set `--humanoid-type=smplx` if using SMPL-X. Add the flag `--create-text-embeddings` to create text embeddings (for MaskedMimic).
